## Multi-trait Point Pattern Reconstruction

The **M**ulti-**T**rait **P**oint **P**attern **R**econstruction (MTPPR) method enables the reconstruction of point patterns with multiple traits. This GitHub repository contains all the functions in the form of R scripts, as well as several datasets that can be used. Additionally, you can find a handbook <a href="https://chriswudel.github.io/MTPPR-handbook/" target="_blank">here</a> to facilitate application and accessibility. Further information about the reconstruction method can be found in <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.14206" target="_blank">Wudel et al. (2023)</a>.
